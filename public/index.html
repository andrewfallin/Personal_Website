The current system for users to plan their experiments is to remain in constant contact with the instrument science team either through phone calls or email. The two instrument scientists must split their time between running experiments and planning the next batch. Making planning tools widely available to Users would alleviate some of the stress put on the planning process and allow the instrument scientists to focus more of their attention of the current project.<br><br>My responsibilities were to gather requirements from the instrument scientists and develop the appropriate tools to suit their needs. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Twitter Bootstrap to build these tools.

            <p>Secret Santa gift exchange manager app. The app allows users to create multiple Secret Santa Gift exchanges. When creating their exchange, the users are able to add as many participants as they would like by entering their name and email. These are then added to a table where the user may delete a participant if they would like before beginning the exchange. They also set a price cap and the date of the exchange. Once the user clicks start, the exchange will begin and all participants (including the user) receive an email with the exchange information (price cap, rules, date) as well as who they are assigned to give a gift to. <br><br>On another page the user is able to manage current exchanges. If a participant A were to leave the exchange then an email would be sent to the participant B, who was giving a gift to participant A, informing them their giftee had left the exchange and reassign them to the giftee of participant A.<br><br>Additionally, if the user were to delete the exchange entirely then all participants would receive an email informing them the exchange had been canceled.<br><br>I created this when I realized that the person who was planning the gift exchange missed out on the best part of Secret Santa, not knowing who is getting you a gift. The app takes care of all assignments so everyone can participate. To accomplish this, I programmed in Swift and used the IOS Software Development Kit. </p>

            <p>The Center for Advanced Studies in Adaptive Systems (CASAS) is a research group dedicated to the research and design of smart homes. More specifically, CASAS’ goal is to install smart tech in elderly patient’s homes to provide them with more autonomy while not sacrificing the assisted care they need. If a patient were to injure themselves or have a medical issue, then the house would contact the proper authorities.<br><br>One aspect the the research group is beginning to implement is a Robot Activity Support System (RAS). The RAS is being designed to help patients with general reminders for daily tasks. The need for a more intuitive interface with the robot was quickly identified. Therefore, CASAS tasked my senior design team with building a voice control system that could be installed in the home and provide patients with a simpler mode of interaction.<br><br>After talking with the team, we decided that we wanted to try to keep the voice control module “in-house” as much as possible, without relying on outside services such as AWS. Because of this we chose to build our system on a Raspberry Pi 3B+. The CASAS team also stated that they wanted two forms of system feedback, so we added a Blinkt LED strip to the GPIO pins and a USB speaker so the system could provide audio feedback. Further, our system took in voice commands through a conference microphone.<br><br>For the software, we built off of an open source voice control framework called Jasper. Jasper provided a very intuitive way for adding new commands. You simply had to add a new file to the modules folder, tell it the keywords to look out for, and then run the program. On runtime, all files in the modules folder are loaded as commands.<br><br>When the user gives a command to the system, the command is saved into a NoSQL database Redis. In addition to the command, Redis also stores the location (XYZ coordinates and room name) of each Raspberry Pi. Another process is running called Jasper Connect. This process checks to see if the Redis key exists. If it does then the value stored at that key, as well as the location and the measured sound level, are compiled into a JSON object and published to the CASAS XMPP middleware. The robot team then is able to pull the information down to their systems and manipulate it as necessary.<br><br>As project leader, my responsibilities included scheduling meetings with our team and clients, assigning tasks to the team, and submitting all generated documents. I was also in charge of writing code to connect and send commands to the middleware.</p>

            <p>Our file system was built in a tree-like manner using C. If the command ‘mkdir’ was entered, for example, a new directory with a pointer back to a directory is created. Additionally, the new directory is given the permissions to store files. If the command ‘touch’ is entered, then a new file is created in the current directory. A new pointer is created that points from the current directory to the file, however; the file is not given permission to store additional directories.<br> <br>Other commands that we supported in our file system were ‘cd’, ‘ls’, ‘pwd’, ‘link’, ‘read’, ‘rmdir’, ‘creat’, ‘write’, ‘cat’, ‘cp’, ‘open’, and ‘close’. Each of these involved different levels of string and pointer manipulation. For example, ‘cd’ would take the current working directory pointer and reassign it to point it at the user specified directory. </p>

            <p>Built a Bullet Hell style shooter game with 5 other students using Object Oriented Programming techniques. Our game featured a player and a series of levels the player would work through, including two boss enemies. All of our enemies inherited from one base enemy class, their differences being defined by how much health they have. Each of these enemies was built using the factory pattern in an effort to add a single point of origin for each of our enemies. This is also how we created all of our bullets.<br><br>For each of enemies we used decorator to define their abilities. For example, our enemies’ movements and extra health were added as a “decoration” when each of the enemies was created.</p>

        <p>When I am not working on a project, in my free time I try to get outdoors as much as possible. If the weather permits, you can find me at a local crag doing some rock climbing or on the trails mountain biking, hiking, or backpacking. If I am brought back inside I frequent a local climbing gym, thriving on puzzling through the moves that will efficiently bring me to the top of the route.</p>
